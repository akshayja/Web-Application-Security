# What is SSL?

## SSL allows web clients and servers to:

1. Verify each otherâ€™s identity.
2. Encrypt messages they send to each other.
3. Ensure the integrity of messages sent between them.

It works through a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption using cryptographic keys tied to an SSL certificate.
