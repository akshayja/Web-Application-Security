# Federated identity

A federated identity in information technology is the means of linking a person's electronic identity and attributes, stored across multiple distinct identity management systems.

Federated identity is related to single sign-on (SSO), in which a user's single authentication ticket, or token, is trusted across multiple IT systems or even organizations.

Single sign-on (SSO) systems allow a single user authentication process across multiple IT systems or even organizations. 

The ultimate goal of identity federation is to enable users of one domain to securely access data or systems of another domain seamlessly, and without the need for completely redundant user administration.

## Technologies used for federated identity include 
1. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language), 
2. OAuth, 
3. OpenID, 
4. Security Tokens (Simple Web Tokens, JSON Web Tokens, and SAML assertions),
5. Web Service Specifications, 
 and Windows Identity Foundation.

 ## Typical use-cases involve things such as 
 cross-domain,
 web-based single sign-on, 
 cross-domain user account provisioning,
 cross-domain entitlement management 
 and cross-domain user attribute exchange.
 
## Principles of OAuth2.0
 It is designed primarily as a means of granting access to a set of resources, for example, remote APIs or userâ€™s data.
